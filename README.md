#  Python Logic : The 50 Program Challenge

This repository is my personal "logic gym." My goal is to write 50 Python programs to master syntax, problem-solving, and program flow.

---

##  Progress Tracker
- [x] **01: Shop Totalizer** - Handles running totals and item summaries using lists.
- [x] **02: zero_count_factorial** - Helps in finding Factorial as well as Trailing Zeros using recursion and while loop. 
- [x] **03: Currency Exchage**- Helps in converting currencies to PKR using Dictionary and Function.

##  How to Run
1. Clone this repo.
2. Run any script using: 
   `shop_calculater.py`,
   `zero_count_factorial.py`,
   `currency_exchange.py`

##  Lessons Learned
- How to use `while True` loops with a `break` condition.
- Using `enumerate()` to make clean, numbered lists.
- How to find factorials using `Recursive Approch`.
- Concept of `trailing Zeros`.  
- `Legendre’s` Insight.
- How to use `Functions`
- How to connect `Dictionary` to the other code
- `Logic Flow` still learning
