#  Python Logic : The 50 Program Challenge

This repository is my personal "logic gym." My goal is to write 50 Python programs to master syntax, problem-solving, and program flow.

---

##  Progress Tracker
- [x] **01: Shop Totalizer** - Handles running totals and item summaries using lists.
- [x] **02: zero_count_factorial** - Helps in finding Factorial as well as Trailing Zeros using recursion and while loop. 
- [x] **03: Currency Exchange**- Helps in converting currencies to PKR using Dictionary and Function.  
- [x] **04: Water Reminder**- A water Reminder that reminds you to drink water  
- [x] **05: Password Generator**- It will help you to generate random passwords!
- [x] **06: sum_product_function**- It will ask numbers and give you sum,product on the base of condition!
- {x} **07: bill_splitter**-  It will split the expenses between your Roomates 
- [x] **08: salary_tracker**- A salary_tracker using OOP

##  How to Run
1. Clone this repo.
2. Run any script using: 
   `shop_calculater.py`,
   `zero_count_factorial.py`,
   `currency_exchange.py`,
   `water_reminder.py`,
   `password_generator.py`
3. To run the reminder silently in the background :
   `pythonw water_reminder.py` (hope it helps)      
   `sum_product_function.py`  
   `bill_splitter.py`


##  Lessons Learned
- How to use `while True` loops with a `break` condition.
- Using `enumerate()` to make clean, numbered lists.
- How to find factorials using `Recursive Approch`.
- Concept of `trailing Zeros`.  
- `Legendre’s` Insight.
- How to use `Functions`
- How to connect `Dictionary` to the other code
- `Logic Flow` still learning
- Got to know about python library `plyer`
- Got to know about python library `string`
- Got to know about python library `random`
- how to handle `input` with functions
- took a Dive into `OOP`
